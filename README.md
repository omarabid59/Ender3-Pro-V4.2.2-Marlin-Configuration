# Ender3-Pro-V4.2.2-Marlin-Configuration


A modified Ender 3 Pro Marlin Configuration for use with the V4.2.2 board. The settings have been modified from the sample configuration provided [here](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.0.x/config/examples/Creality/Ender-3%20Pro/CrealityV422).

# Features

# How To Use
There are several guides available online for how to compile and update the firmware. I followed the [All3DP Ender 3 V2 Firmware Update](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-v2-firmware-update/) guide.
